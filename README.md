# Introduction
This project seeks to address the challenge of imitating the style of a particular artist when creating new images or altering existing images. This challenge will be attempted using a generative adversarial network (GAN). GANs consist of a generator model and discriminator model. The generator creates images and the discriminator compares them with real images to train the generator.

Claude Monet was an important figure in the Impressionist movement. He frequently depicted scenes from Paris and the Normandy coast, particularly landscapes. His style has been described as striving to capture the very act of perceiving nature. Inspired by Japanese woodprints, he emphasized the two-dimensional surfaces of forms and eliminated linear perspective.[3]

The goal of this project is to transform photographs or generate images that imitate this unique style.
